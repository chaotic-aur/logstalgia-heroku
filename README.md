# Heroku formatter for [Logstalgia][]

The formatter ruby file is modified from someone else's hard work! I can't seem
for find the original any more so if it was you let me know so I can give you
credit.

## Usage

Run `debug.sh` to print the output of the log formatter to make sure everything
looks as it should.

Run `run.sh` to run Logstalgia with the log formatter for Heroku.
